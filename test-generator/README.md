# Testing Directory Structure Creation Tool

This tool is a command-line application that reads a YAML file to create a complex directory and file structure on your filesystem. It allows for defining the name, size, and count of files and nesting of directories.

## Usage

To use the tool, run the executable from the command line followed by the path(s) to one or more YAML files:

```bash
go run . sample-files.yml
```

## YAML File Structure

See the example file `sample-files.yml` for the structure.
